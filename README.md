# Docker_profanity
Dockerfile for creating container to work with profanity

To do: Make copy path for Windows (if necessary). I believe this is the volume mount paths in statup.sh. Right now they are Linux paths. The container is bound to :0 display of x11. I am not sure it will work on windows, perhaps on Ubuntu on Windows.
